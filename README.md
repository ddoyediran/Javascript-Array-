# Javascript Arrays
Understand Arrays in JavaScript - There are lot of resources out there that covers Arrays in JavaScript but only few explain the topic for the purpose of Data Structures and Algorithms. Maybe, this will prompt a short book on Data Structures and Algorithms with Javascript. 
You are free to ask question and as well contribute to make it better. 
# Introduction to Arrays in JavaScript
Arrays is one of the most basic and widely data structure in any programming language. It can as well be called Arrays Data Structure. 

Arrays are use to store or holds a fixed number of values of a single type. 

For any Array created, you can perform four operations on it which are Access, Insertion, Deletion, and Search. 

Another interesting thing about Arrays - It has length (fixed when it is created) and index. Let's look at image below and example to understand what I meant by length and index.

Example:

`var myArray = [3, 8, 4, 9, 7, 6];`

If you count the elements inside myArray, it has 6 elements. Which means, it has a length of 6 and index of 5 (note: counting index always start from 0).


### Access 

You can access an Array by specifying the index number you want to access. 

for example:

```
var myArray = [3, 8, 4, 9, 7, 6];

myArray[2]; //will returns 4.

myArray[4]; //will returns 7

```

Accessing array is that simple. ðŸ˜„
